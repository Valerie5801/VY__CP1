#VY 2nd Order Up

#create four dictionaries, one for each of these categories: drinks, sides, and main meals
#each dictionary must have at least 4 different menu items(eight for sides, since the user needs to order two side dishes), and each menu item must have a cost. Do a nested dictionary for this.

#greet the user
#print the full menu by looping through the dictionary
#afterwards, ask the user what drink they would like
    #if the drink is not found in the dictionary, tell them to order again
#ask the user what their first side is
    #if the side is not found in the dictionary, tell them to order again.
#ask the user what their second side is, or if they don't want another side.
    #if the side is not found in the dictionary, tell them to order again.
    #if they don't want a side, don't find it in the dictionary.

#get all of the items that the user ordered, get their price (and if we can, tax them >:])
